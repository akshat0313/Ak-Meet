# Ak-Meet

A Video Calling application.

## About the project

This Project is like Gmeet where we can organise a meeting on a particular date and time, And this application will notify you by sending email on the account by which you have logged in, to join the Meet and in the meeting there will be a chatting option and also a whiteboard feature for all the participants.

## What I used
### Frontend
1) Tailwind.

2) Bootstrap.

### Backend

1) Google Authentication.

2) PeerJs for connecting to different IDs.

3) WebRTC to capture and optionally stream audio and/or video media.

## Installation

NodeJs should be installed in your system otherwise install it from [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). 

Use npm to install the required dependencies

```bash
npm install 
```
It will install all the required dependencies in a folder named Node modules

Now to run the server give the command

```bash
npm start
```
It will run the sever on your local host so now on your browser go to the link "http://localhost:3000"

2) Whiteboard functionality.
